## Requirements

See [Set up Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/set-up-forge/) for instructions to get set up.

## Quick start

- Build and deploy your app by running: `forge deploy`
- Install your app in an Atlassian site by running: `forge install`
- Develop your app by running `forge tunnel` to proxy invocations locally: `forge tunnel`

### Notes

- Use the `forge deploy` command when you want to persist code changes.
- Use the `forge install` command when you want to install the app on a new site.
- Once the app is installed on a site, the site picks up the new app changes you deploy without needing to rerun the install command.
